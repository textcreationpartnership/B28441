            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPOSAL Humbly offered To the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> FOR RAISING A Considerable Sum of Mony Yearly to His MAJESTY.</head>
            <head type="sub">BY <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Mordington, B. Whitelocke</hi> Esq; and <hi>Rich. Cotton</hi> Cloth-Worker.</head>
            <p>THAT an <hi>Imposition</hi> be laid upon all <hi>Broad Cloth; <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </hi> on the finest Sort of 12 Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings <hi>per</hi> Yard and upwards, the Sum of Three Pence <hi>per</hi> Yard; On the middling Sort from Six to Twelve Shillings <hi>per</hi> Yard, the Sum of Two Pence <hi>per</hi> Yard; On all Broad Cloth under Six Shillings <hi>per</hi> Yard, One Penny <hi>per</hi> Yard. And propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably on all Stuffs, Serges; and all other woven wollen Manufactures.</p>
            <p>That Offices be erected in requisite Places, with leaden Seals and Stamps to be set on the Cloth, Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon pain of Forfeiture, if sold without.</p>
            <p>This by Computation will produce to His Majesty about Two Millions <hi>per Annum,</hi> from what is Imported, Exported, and Spent here. Which will be a very considerable Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the <hi>King,</hi> for His carrying on the present War with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, far from proving a heavy <hi>Tax</hi> upon the Commodities aforesaid, 'twill scarce be felt by the Nation. For he that wears the finest Cloth shall pay but Nine Pence for a Suit consisting at most of Three Yards, and perhaps of Three or Four Pounds Value or more; For the middling Sort, Six Pence <hi>per</hi> Suit; and for the courselt, Three Pence <hi>per</hi> Suit. The Wearer or Spender in reality paying the Tax; and the Clothier, Merchant, and Retailer paying nothing but what they receive again from the Spender.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> and all <hi>forein Nations,</hi> will Contribute by the Exportation, more than Our Selves; the Exportations being generally far beyong the Quantity of What we spend at Home, and the Merchants receiving again from their forein Correspondents what they Pay here for the <hi>Tax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, whereas there are great Quantities of our <hi>English Wool</hi> and <hi>Fullers Earth</hi> Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted daily beyond Sea (which is the greatest Detriment to the Cloathing Trade, the chief Manufacture of this Kingdom) an Effectual Law to prevent the Exporation thereof for the future will much Advance the Interest of the Kingdom in general, and of the King in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as will appear by these Two following Reasons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. That <hi>English Wool</hi> is naturally Oily and Fat, and will mix with any other Wool. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Forein Wool</hi> being naturally Dry, and either too Course or too Fine, cannot be Milled or Fulled to any Perfection, without a Mixture of ours.</item>
               <item>II. That without <hi>English Wool</hi> and <hi>Fullers Earth,</hi> no good Cloth can be made in any Part of the World, besides <hi>England.</hi> And consequently by such Effectual Prohibition the whole Trade universally will be our own. Which will very much Inrich the Nation, and with this Imposition will yield a very great Yearly Revenue to the King; easy to every one in particular, and an Ease to the Nation in general, in Raising the present necessary Supplies for the War.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And this moreover answers all Objections of the Clothiers. Who, besides their Paying nothing but what they receive again upon Sale as before, will by such Effectual Prohibition receive far greater Advantage, than they can any ways pretend to be Grieved by this Tax.</p>
            <p>The Discoveries of the several Ways and Methods used, together with the Advantages and Correspondencies made for the clandestine Exportation both of our Wool and Fullers Earth, being a great Help and Insight to Reform and Prevent these Abuses; the said Proposers are ready to make out the same, with some other Precautions to that effect, if these their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possals find Acceptance.</p>
